# KMeans Cluster Analysis

After reviewing the exploratory data and maps, we wish to identify clusters based on several census-based data we are importing into our dataset.
These added columns represent several assumptions that we wish to test:

## Added variables from the ACS

MISSING EXPL OF VARIABLES CREATION

MISSING VARIABLES TABLE -> TO BE CREATED WITH MATPLOTLIB?

## Initial Cluster analysis

THE CODE! 

the plot of the chart with the colors and weights

The plot of the first map

## Adjusting the number of clusters using the elbow method

an explanation of why

The graph of the first test

the code to get the value

## Adjusted Map of Clusters
